# Advent of Code 2023 Day 11 in Rust

Solutions for Day 11 of Advent of Code 2023 in Rust, one self rolled, one from YT channel uncle_scientist.
A cpp solution is also included.

## Feature: Swift

If you build or bench with -F Swift, a swift solution will be build and benched as well. However, to be able
to do this, one needs the most recent beta 6.0 version of Swift installed. The build activates it using the
TOOLCHAINS environment variable.
